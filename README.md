Code On Deck is about writing code.   
Be it for fun, challenge or anything, writing code is fun.   
We blog and buzz about what we do. 



Ideas: 

 - [ ] Awesome list website where people can vote up/down. 
   - You can use reverse-dl to spread updates
 - [ ] A completely anonymous publishing website. No identifying details needed to publish.
 - [ ] Cheat sheet based on markdown
   - With a chrome extension. Give it a link and it will render a markdown.
